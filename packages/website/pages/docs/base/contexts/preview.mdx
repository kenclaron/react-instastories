# usePreviewContext

## Description

The `usePreview` hook is a React hook for managing a `Preview` component.
It provides a set of methods to control the visibility of the preview and handle associated events such as showing, hiding, and clicking the preview.
This hook is particularly useful for implementing preview features in applications where previews need to be shown or hidden based on user interactions.
