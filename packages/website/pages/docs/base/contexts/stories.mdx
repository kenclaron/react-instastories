# useStoriesContext

## Description

The `useStoriesContext` hook is a React hook designed to manage the state and behavior of stories within a component.
It handles the navigation between stories, the current story index, and any associated props or child elements.
This hook is particularly useful for implementing story-like features in applications where users can navigate through different stories.
