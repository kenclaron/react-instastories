# useViewerContext

## Description

The `useViewerContext` hook manages the state and behavior of the viewer component.
It provides a comprehensive set of methods and properties to control the opening, closing, showing, and hiding of the viewer.
The hook integrates with [animations](/docs/base/models/animation), [transitions](/docs/base/models/steps), and [config](/docs/base/instastories#configuration) to offer a seamless viewing experience.

| `onOpen`       | `Function`                                 | Callback function triggered when the viewer opens. If the function returns a `truthy` value, then the function will prevent the viewer component from opening.     |
| `onShow`       | `Function`                                 | Callback function triggered when the viewer is shown. If the function returns a `truthy` value, then the function will prevent the viewer component from opening.  |
| `onClose`      | `Function`                                 | Callback function triggered when the viewer closes. If the function returns a `truthy` value, then the function will prevent the viewer component from opening.    |
