# Hook useStory

## Description

The `useStory` hook is a custom React hook that provides access to the current story context within your application.
It uses the `StoryContext` to supply story-specific information, such as the `HTMLElement` associated with the story and the index of the story.
This hook is particularly useful for components that need to be aware of their position or associated element within a story-based paginated interface.

## Usage

To use the `useStory` hook, import it into your component and call it. The hook returns an object containing the current story's `HTMLElement` and index.

```tsx copy
import { useStory } from "@react-instastories/base";

import React from "react";

function InnerStoryContent() {
  const story = useStory();

  React.useEffect(() => console.debug(story), [story]);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Story Information</h1>
      <p>Story Index: {story.index}</p>
      <p>Story Id Element: {story.element?.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
