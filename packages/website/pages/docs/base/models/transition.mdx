# Transition

The library allows to track the opening state of a viewer `<dialog>` using JS-steps and CSS-classnames that are automatically assigned to the `<dialog>` container of the viewer for easy interaction by JS or CSS.

## Properties

| Property    | Type                                        | Description                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `storyRef`  | `React.MutableRefObject<HTMLDivElement>`    | The ref object of [story](/docs/base/story).                            |
| `viewerRef` | `React.MutableRefObject<HTMLDialogElement>` | The ref object of [viewer](/docs/base/instastories).                    |
| `step`      | [`TransitionStep`](#steps)                  | The configuration settings for the [viewer](/docs/base/instastories).   |
| `cancel`    | `Function`                                  | Function to cancel the transition (clear step value and set as `null`). |

## viewer

Current step can be accessing by following code with [ViewerContext](/docs/base/contexts/viewer)

## Usage

```tsx copy
import { useViewerContext } from "@react-instastories/base";

// Component that renders current step as string
function CurrentStep() {
  const viewer = useViewerContext();

  return viewer.transition.step; // null or "entering" -> "entered" -> "exiting" -> "exited"
}

// Examples of usage
<InstaStories>
  <Configurable.Container>
    <Configurable.Viewer>
      <CurrentStep />
    </Configurable.Viewer>
  </Configurable.Container>
  <Stories>
    <Story>
      <Preview>
        <CurrentStep />
      </Preview>
      <Pages>
        <Page>
          <CurrentStep />
        </Page>
      </Pages>
    </Story>
  </Stories>
</InstaStories>;
```

## Steps

### Open

When the viewer is opening, the following class names are applied to indicate the state of the viewer:

1. `TransitionStep.Entering` (classname: `.instastories-viewer--entering`)

   - This class prevented when [animation](/docs/base/models/animation) prop in config equals to `immediately`
   - This class is applied when the viewer starts to open. You can use this class to define the initial styles or animations for the opening process.
   - Typically used to set up the starting point for the transition or animation.

2. `TransitionStep.Entered` (classname: `.instastories-viewer--entered`)
   - This class is applied after the opening animation or transition ends, specifically after the `transitionend` event with `opacity` or any `animationend` event.
   - Use this class to define the final styles or animations that should be applied once the viewer is fully opened.
   - This state indicates that the viewer has completed the opening process and is now fully visible.

### Close

When the viewer is closing, the following `classNames` are used to represent the state of the viewer:

1. `TransitionStep.Exiting` (classname: `.instastories-viewer--exiting`)

   - This class prevented when [animation](/docs/base/models/animation) prop in config equals to `immediately`
   - This class is applied when the viewer starts to close. It helps in defining the initial styles or animations for the closing process.
   - Typically used to initiate the closing transition or animation.

2. `TransitionStep.Exited` (classname: `.instastories-viewer--exited`)

   - This class prevented when [animation](/docs/base/models/animation) prop in config equals to `immediately`
   - This class is applied after the closing animation or transition ends, specifically after the `transitionend` event with `opacity` or any `animationend` event.
   - Use this class to define the final styles or animations that should be applied once the viewer is fully closed.
   - This state indicates that the viewer has completed the closing process and is no longer visible.
